# Trackonomy Hackathon

## Problem Statement

## Solution
The web application enables to visualize shipment tracking data with temperature monitoring capabilities. Users upload excel files containing location coordinates and temperature readings, then choose between two visualization options: a map view that plots shipment locations with color-coded temperature indicators (green for the optimal 15-25Â°C range, red for alerts),  a time-series chart displaying temperature fluctuations over the journey with clear visual indicators of when readings fall outside the acceptable range. 

## Tools and Technology
The frontend uses HTML for structure, CSS for styling and javaScript for functionality. It uses several key libraries: Google Maps API for geographical visualization and heatmap layers, SheetJS (xlsx) for parsing excel data files, and Chart.js adapter for creating interactive time-series visualizations.
